# Blooger_Website
This is the complete blooger website create using html, css and basics of Js.

Our theme for the Devathon Problem Statement is MINIMALISM.
Minimalism is all about owning only what adds value and meaning to your life and removing the rest. It's about removing the clutter and using your time and energy for the things that remain.
We have added basic pastel shades to calm the viewer's eyes. And given our website a little modern touch.

Our website has a Navigation Bar.
